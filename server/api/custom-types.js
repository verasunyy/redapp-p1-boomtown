/**
*  @TODO: Custom Types
*  GraphQL includes the following built-in Scalar Types: https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types
*
*  The purpose of the Scalar type is to validate the information being sent and received
*  from our GraphQL API.
*
*  Apollo allows us to define our own custom types. We’ll create our own custom type to handle the value from the ‘created’ field
*  on the Item: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/scalars.html
*
*  Once you’ve defined your custom DATE type, don’t forget to add it to your schema.
